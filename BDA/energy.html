        <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;width:80%;text-align:justify;position:relative;">      Recognizing the growing demands and benefits of renewable energy sources, we have completed a detailed due diligence as well as conducted a full analysis on the economic viability of a 100MW solar power plant located near Three Springs, Western Australia.
      We have acquired 502 Hectares of land for this project, with the capability to further expand the plant if desired. Power will be evacuated through the Three Springs sub-station with grid connection to a 330 KV line.
      We have obtained a PPA for off-take once the plant is commissioned, further securing the viability of the project for potential investors. We are currently in the final stages of raising equity capital for investment in this project.

In 2007 our Managing Director Prakash Seth noted the increasing disparity between demand from the mining industry for diesel and supply capabilities of existing refineries within Australia. With a vision to create the world’s first completely unmanned facility, the 75 Mega Litre diesel storage facility was designed by BDA, using the latest state of the art technologies and systems available from around the world.

All processes including product testing, accounting and inventory management, and security systems, were fully automated, with complete suppliers & customers integration online, thus requiring no humans.

BDA raised capital for the $50 million project, and under the structure of a joint venture with Morgan Stanley, developed the storage facility.

The facility is one of a kind with two patented inventions created by our Managing Director, Prakash Seth. This diesel storage facility is located in Mackay, Queensland, with an annual throughput capacity of 1.8 billion Litres. Blue Oil Energy’s share in this facility was sold in 2015.
